# HELLOWORLD
I wish I new what I was going here or what I have to do next.  I am more of a pen and writing on a scrap of paper kind of person with piles of notes and drawing of things I want to make, so I am kind of learning this computer stuff as I go.  So I am doing what I can to figure it out with a lots of trials and errors.
